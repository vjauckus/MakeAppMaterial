# MakeAppMaterial
## Udacity project 5 

The design project shows usage of material design principles. Some of them are:

  - Co-ordinator layout added with scroll effects in ArticleListActivity(MainActivity) with Appbarlayout
  - Animation of Floating Action Button (FAB), that rotates on click, before showing the share options. 
  - Viewpager Transition effect when switching pages. 
  - Appcompat theme with nice colors applied. 
  - Roboto Fonts are used globally through the app. 
  - Palette Library picks up the content scrim color for the Collapsing Toolbar. 
  - The windowSharedElementEnterTransition was applied.
  - Maintaining state even after rotation.
  - Responsive Design for phones and tablets.
