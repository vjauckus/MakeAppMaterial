# MakeAppMaterial
## Udacity project 5 
The design project shows usage of material design principles. Some of them are:

    1. Co-ordinator layout added with scroll effects in ArticleListActivity(MainActivity) with Appbarlayout
    2. Animation of Floating Action Button (FAB), that rotates on click, before showing the share options in the DetailFragment page. 
    3. Viewpager Transition effect when switching pages. 
    4. Appcompat theme with nice colors applied. 
    5. Roboto Fonts are used globally through the app. 
    6. Palette Library picks up the content scrim color for the Collapsing Toolbar. 
    7. The windowSharedElementEnterTransition was applied.
    8. Maintaining state even after rotation.
    9. Responsive Design for phones and tablets.
